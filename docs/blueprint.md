# **App Name**: LogisticX

## Core Features:

- Interactive Continent Map: A visually engaging, interactive continent map or grid, as central navigation, enriched with subtle animations to enhance user experience and guide users to specific export data.
- Data Visualization: Display data from JSON (emulating a database) in sortable, filterable tables, providing insights into trade agreements, customs, and logistical information for each country, ensuring an organized and easily understandable format.
- Dynamic Route Links: Integrate dynamic links that guide users to external resources such as route details and country profiles, ensuring the app acts as a central hub for all necessary export-related information.
- Contextual Internal Transport: Offer specialized information on internal transport routes within Peru for South American exports, providing tailored logistical solutions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant yellow (#FFD700), inspired by the UX Machina reference, is used as a vibrant accent color to highlight interactive elements and key information.
- Background color: Dark gray (#0A0A0A) creates a sophisticated backdrop, enhancing the visibility of content and ensuring a modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: Light gray (#A0A0A0) is employed to provide subtle contrast and a muted highlight on supporting text.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) is used across the platform. The modern, clean look contributes to readability.
- Use minimalist SVG icons for continents and trailer symbols within the interactive map. Icons should intuitively represent their corresponding functions and fit with the rest of the design.
- Incorporate a subtle background animation of an abstract atom or network of nodes, gently responding to user scrolling or cursor movement. Also add micro-interactions on continent cards during hover and click events.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the continent selector and tables, maintaining a clean, orderly presentation of information that is easy to navigate and interpret.
